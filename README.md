# Rohingya-Quran-Assets

The Holy Quran is the final Revelation from Allah reveled to the last messenger Mohammad (ﷺ). This Project intends to translate the Holy Quran into Arakanese Rohingya Language, the language of the world’s most persecuted Muslim minority of Arakan, Burma. The objective of this project is to translate the Holy Quran in to Rohingya language by using authentic translated version as a point of reference such as English and Urdu. Due to decades old exposure of this minority to a systematic genocide and Buddhist aggression, the Holy Quran is still unavailable in this language. This project is first of its kind to translate Words of Allah and to open up the doors of light to Rohingya people for generations to come. This paper proposes to translate the entire Holy Quran in audio and video series for multipurpose usage and easy distribution.
